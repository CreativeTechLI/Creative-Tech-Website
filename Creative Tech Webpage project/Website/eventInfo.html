            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Here's a free excercise set to get you started</p>
        <p class="border_under"> Regardless of your fitness level or swimming techniques, there is a workout here for you. By using these plans you can develop a full swimming training program. Some of the workouts contain challenging swimming drills, others help you work on strokes and swimming techniques. Browse the categories and look at the workout goals to choose the swim workouts that fit your needs. Don't try to memorize the workout. Instead use a waterproof slate and write the workout on it in pencil. An average slate can hold 2-3 workouts on each side. Take your slate to the pool with you then it's as simple as going down the list. You will find that using a preplanned swim workout will help you with counting laps, and will also help you focus more on the workout.

            <p>Total Distance: 600 yards</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 x 50 yards freestyle warmup
        (rest between laps if needed)</li>
   <li> 4 x 25 yards freestyle counting strokes per length
       (try to keep an even number of strokes)</li>
    <li>4 x 50 freestyle resting :30 between each lap
        (try to hit the same time on each lap)</li>
    <li>4 x 25 yards freestyle counting strokes per length
        (try to keep an even number of strokes)</li>
   <li> 2 x 50 freestyle warmdown
       (swim slowly and relax)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="border_upper">This is the beginning workout used by someone just getting started in swimming. The distance of 600 yards may seem like a long way at first glance. However, if you follow the workout and break it up you will complete the distance easily. If your swimming techniques are not strong enough you might want to consider taking swim lessons or join a swim program with a coach and other swimmers that are happy to help. If you go it alone take your time and ease into the workouts. There are very few injuries related to swimming but they do occur. </p>
